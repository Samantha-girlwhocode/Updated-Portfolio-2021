                    it's hard to focus on one project! Though I'm very keen to learn

                    <p>
                        I made this website as a part of the creative segment of an English asignment I had been
                        assigned. It has a lot of references in it to the Crucible and the show Gossip Girls and I made
                        it in a way to address the prompt of the project so let me give you some background information
                        so you can further understand it! Basically we were trying to show how the Crucible (a movie and
                        play about the Salem Witch Trials) compares to events that go on in the present. I though since
                        there was lots of bullying and gossip that took place in the Crucible it reminded me of Gossip
                        Girl which is a show that revolves around this website called Gossip Girl which people put
                        gossip on. So I made a version of the Gossip Girl website, using references from the show and
                        the crucibe to show how the Crucible was similar to Cyber Bullying.
